GOAL:
   This program lets a business owner know how their business is doing
quantitatively.
It is hoped that this program, available libre, is especially useful to
small and medium-size business owners, who may not have the resources to
hire a professional consultant to see how their business is doing 
quantitatively, by providing some basic statistics about their business
(with more and more relevant and useful statistics/features to be added with 
time).
    A basic assumption is that most business decisions come down to two 
distinct factors:
1. An objective factor, which involves mathematically calculating the costs
and benefits of various options.
2. A subjective factor, which involves ``common sense'', ``business sense'',
ethics and other non-quantifiable variables.
The goal of this project is to tackle the former factor, efficiently and in a
cost-effective manner, while the latter is left to be evaluated by the 
stakeholders in the business.
An important implicit assumption being made here is that the 2 aforementioned
factors can be de-coupled.
Another important factor in making business decisions is
the enumeration of various options at the beginning.
Frequently, this also requires some qualities mentioned in item #2 above.
It will be assumed that this has already been done and a business decision
is to be made regarding choosing between different options based on some
quantitative criteria.
So, the program will start off from a given option and evaluate its merits
based on given data.
